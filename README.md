# LibraryManagementSystem
This is a Library Management System that is console based and in Java. This is a project that I had made for my java class back in 2023 with my partner Nick McCarry.

This program sorts through a list of books, and than proceeds to sort them based on in they are fiction or non-fiction. Afterwards, what will happen is the user is prompted via the console, to choose what they want to do with the program, whether that is putting themselves into the system, checking out books, or sorting the book by: name or ISBN.
